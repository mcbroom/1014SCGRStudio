# 1. Hypothesis Testing -- The General Process

## 1.1 The Concept

The first area of statistical inference that we discuss involves using
sample data to test some sort of belief. The second branch of
statistical inference, estimation, will be discussed later.

Do the sample data support the claim made by the researcher? In such
situations there are two main types of question:

1.  Question asked is:

***Is the value (parameter) as proposed?***

-   Is the proportion of males equal to 0.5?

-   Is the standard deviation of leaf area greater than 10% of its mean?

-   Is the maximum energy output greater than 10kw?

-   Is the mean dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Brisbane river below the
    critical level for fish survival?

2.  Question asked is:

***Are the parameters the same for different groups/situations/etc?***

-   Is the mean level of NOX (nitrogen oxide) in the atmosphere
    increasing -- time 1 versus time 2?

-   Is a particular grass species more tolerant to pressure from foot
    traffic than another grass species?

-   Is the average house loan through a particular bank the same this
    year as at the same time last?

## 1.2 The Basic Steps for Hypothesis Testing -- the HT 10 steps

1.  Identify clearly the scientific problem and question.

2.  From the identified question, clearly define the research hypothesis
    at issue.

3.  Decide on the resources, required detectable difference and
    significance level.

4.  Formulate the statistical hypotheses: null and alternative.

5.  Determine the theoretical model - based on null hypothesis and
    assumptions.

6.  Identify the test statistic, its null distribution, and the relevant
    critical region.

7.  Obtain the sample data and calculate the sample test statistic.

8.  Compare the sample test statistic with the null distribution using
    the critical region OR evaluate the p-value for the test.

9.  Make statistical conclusion and interpret result in terms of
    original question.

10. Consider the possible errors - type I, type II.

## 1.3 The Scientific Problem and Question

It is the duty of the researcher to identify and explain the problem
being studied. If this is not carried out with care improper, incorrect,
and/or misleading conclusions may occur.

## 1.4 The Research Hypothesis

-   A specific belief about some feature of the population variable --
    eg a mean, proportion, range.
-   The feature will describe the variable in some way.
-   The feature must be measurable or observable (not necessarily
    quantitative).
-   Also known as a scientific hypothesis or an English hypothesis.
-   Refers to a situation, problem, question.

Dictionary Definitions of the English word hypothesis

> Supposition made as basis for reasoning, without assumption of its
> truth, or as starting-point for investigation (The Concise Oxford
> Dictionary, 1975)

> A proposition assumed as a premise in an argument; a proposition (or
> set of propositions) proposed as an explanation for the occurrence of
> some specified group of phenomena, either asserted or merely as a
> provisional conjecture to guide investigation (Macquarie Concise
> Dictionary, 1996)

One of the most common problem areas in research design is inadequate
clarification of the research hypothesis -- it must be specific and
unambiguous; it must be clear what is to be measured. What may seem
obvious to the researcher at the time may be less than obvious to
someone else, for example a research assistant actually collecting the
data, and may be no longer obvious to anyone at a later date!

**Example:**

Decide whether each of the following is a good research hypothesis.

1.  36% of Australian females between 15 and 24 years of age smoke
    cigarettes.

2.  The probability that a cyclone first located in the Coral Sea will
    cross the Queensland coast is 0.20.

3.  Budgerigars in inland Australia have a smaller range of body weights
    than do budgerigars on the coast.

4.  The minimum temperature in Brisbane never goes below 0$^{\circ}$C.

5.  The average Mastercard debt is \$600.

6.  Toyota Corollas are better cars than Ford Lasers.

7.  Most people eat meat.

8.  OPs in Private Schools cover a smaller range than OPs in State
    Schools.

9.  Five percent of women who take the contraceptive pill still fall
    pregnant.

10. The average level of hydrocarbon concentration in body tissues
    increases up the food chain indicating an accumulation process.

11. The noise levels from the freeway are above the maximum decibel
    level set by the Australian standards.

**Difficulties in defining the research hypothesis**

The following are common difficulties encountered by researchers when
they are attempting to define the research hypothesis. - Identifying the
problem of interest - Defining the population - Identifying the specific
question which is being asked - Stating the specific belief

**Remember, the feature describes the population variable**

**Example:** Identify the variables, populations and research hypotheses
for some of the examples given in the example above.

## 1.5 Resources, Required Detectable Differences, Significance Level Required

**Resources:** The resources that are available for the study need to be
assessed at the beginning of the project and compared with the resources
required to achieve the desired aim. If the two are not compatible,
proceeding with the research may be a complete waste of time and money.
Statistical input can help with this process, and 'clever' designs may
enable research that would otherwise not be possible.

**Detectable Differences:** It is important to recognise the difference
between 'statistical difference' and 'observed difference'. For example,
two sample means may have different values, but because of the variation
associated with the measurement, it is not possible to say that they
come from different populations -- they are not statistically different.
The researcher needs to think about the minimum difference he wishes to
be able to detect -- this will influence the size of the sample needed
in the experimental design. It may also mean that the resources will not
be sufficient; this will mean further thinking and maybe the decision
not to go ahead with the study.

**The Significance Level:** The chance the researcher is willing to take
of incorrectly supporting the research hypothesis -- usually designated
by $\alpha$ (alpha). - Traditionally the level is set at 0.05 or 0.01,
**why?** - The level depends on the situation. - 0.05 and 0.01 are like
hair lengths, different people and/or problems require different
reliabilities - be yourself! - The possible error if the conclusion is
to reject the null hypothesis.

## 1.6 The Statistical Hypotheses

**The Alternative Hypothesis** -- $H_1$ or $H_a$

-   The 'research' hypothesis -- possibly reformulated in statistical
    jargon.
-   The 'belief' we want to prove true.
-   The opposite of the null hypothesis.
-   By disproving the null, we say we have 'proved' the alternative.
-   Usually represented as H1

**The Null Hypothesis** - $H_0$

-   Restatement of the research hypothesis in a form that is testable --
    usually involves negation.
-   Expresses the belief about the feature describing the variable in a
    way that is testable.
-   There must be a known theoretical model relating to the distribution
    of the feature OR a way of obtaining an empirical null distribution
    (resampling or bootstrapping).
-   Is true if and only if the alternative is false. We can never prove
    it true.

**Hypotheses are statements about the population not about the sample.**

## 1.7 One and Two Tailed Hypotheses

Where do the tails fit in?

Tails play a significant (pun intended!) role in statistical inference
-- depends on question being asked.

**Two Tailed:**\
Null contains: *equals*

Alternative contains: *not equals*

**One Tailed:**\
Null contains: *equals and greater than* **OR** *equals and less than*

Alternative contains: *less than* **OR** *greater than*

**Example:**

A comparative study is to be carried out on the populations of fiddler
crabs in the Tweed River and the Brisbane River. One aspect to be
studied is the weight of an adult crab, a component of interest to a
potential marketing venture. Write the hypotheses for the following:

1.  Belief: crabs in the Tweed River have a different weight from those
    in the Brisbane River.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

2.  Belief: crabs in the Tweed River weigh more than those in the
    Brisbane River.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

3.  Belief: crabs in the Tweed River weigh less than those in the
    Brisbane River.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## 1.8 Theoretical Models used in Testing Hypotheses

Theoretical models are used to specify the ***null distribution***, that
is, the distribution of the test statistic **if the null hypothesis is
true**.

The model will depend on the measurement and on the feature of interest
in the research hypothesis. For example:

-   A study involves a series of Bernoulli trials; feature of interest
    is a count or proportion - the theoretical model will be the
    Binomial;
-   If a continuous measurement such as weight is to be investigated and
    the mean is of interest - the Normal or t- distribution may be an
    appropriate model;
-   If the aim is to test the goodness of fit of some data to a
    specified distribution - the chi-squared model could be used.

The feature of interest is usually converted to a *test statistic* which
has a known distribution, assuming the null hypothesis is true (the Null
Distribution).

All theoretical models involve assumptions. Violations of these
assumptions may or may not have a dramatic effect on the outcome of any
inference undertaken. If you are ever in any doubts regarding
assumptions and your data, consult a statistician for advice.

## 1.9 The Test Statistic, its Null Distribution, Significance Level and Critical Region

**The Test Statistic:**

-   Usually a function of the 'feature of interest' and is known to have
    a particular distribution -- this contributes to the 'testability'
    of the process.

-   Should be something that has meaning in the context of the feature
    of interest -- if you want to determine if two things are different,
    you might decide to look at their absolute difference, and include
    some sort of weighting -- a difference of two has more impact if the
    values are near10 than if the values are near 1000

For example, when testing hypotheses about the population mean the
equivalent Z score (or t- value if the standard deviation is estimated)
becomes a test statistic.

**The null distribution**

-   Is the probability distribution of the test statistic, assuming the
    null hypothesis is true.
-   If $H_0$ is true, this is the distribution we would expect the
    feature (or some expression based on it) to have.
-   The distribution for the population of 'feature values' if H0 is
    true -- eg, the distribution of the sample mean .

**Significance Level -- alpha,** $\alpha$

The risk you are willing to take that you will reject the null
hypothesis when it is really true. The probability of a Type I error. It
defines the 'cut off' point for the test statistic.

**Critical Region**

-   Determined by the specified significance level, $\alpha$
-   The region of the null distribution where it is considered unlikely
    for a value of the test statistic to occur.
-   If sample value lies here, it is regarded as evidence to reject
    $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$.

***The relationships of the test statistic to the sample and population
are critical.***

## 1.10 Sample Collection and Calculation of Sample Test Statistic

Ways of selecting the sample are discussed at length in various
introductory texts. In general, samples should be random and
representative of the population they are taken from. The test statistic
is calculated as per the definition of whatever 'meaningful' feature has
been selected, given the question asked and the available data -- eg a
count or a mean or a sum of deviations or ...

## 1.11 Comparison of Sample Test Statistic with Null Distribution

-   The sample test statistic is calculated from the observed data and
    compared with the null distribution which reflects the population if
    $H_0$ is true.
-   If the sample test statistic lies in the 'critical region' the null
    hypothesis is rejected at the specified level of significance.
-   If it does not lie in the critical region the null hypothesis is not
    rejected -- the data do not provide evidence to reject the null
    hypothesis in favour of the research (alternative) hypothesis.

## 1.12 The p-Value of a Test

-   Probability of observing a value of the test statistic **as extreme
    as, or more extreme than**, that seen in the sample.
-   Calculated from the null distribution.
-   Called the p-value for the sample test statistic
-   Is the probability of selecting a sample **at least as favourable to
    the research hypothesis** (alternative) as the observed sample.
-   It represents the **attained level of significance** for the test.

## 1.13 Conclusion and Interpretation

-   Depends on whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
-   Remember, **failing to reject the null hypothesis does not mean the
    null hypothesis is true**

## 1.14 Consider Possible Errors:

Two basic types of error can occur whenever hypothesis testing is
carried out. These are summarised in the following table:

|                |                      |          TRUE           |        SITUATION        |
|:----------------|:----------------|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
|                |                      |      $H_0$ is True      |     $H_0$ is False      |
| **TEST**       | Fail to Reject $H_0$ |         Correct         | Type II Error ($\beta$) |
| **CONCLUSION** | Reject $H_0$         | Type I Error ($\alpha$) |         Correct         |

The **LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE** is the probability of making a Type I
error and is under the control of the person carrying out the
statistical test. The symbol used is $\alpha$ (alpha).

The **PROBABILITY OF A TYPE II ERROR** depends on the true alternative
hypothesis (and several other things) and is thus usually unknown. The
symbol used is $\beta$ (beta).

## 1.15 Power of a Statistical Test

-   The power of a statistical test is the probability of correctly
    rejecting the null hypothesis.
-   The probability of correctly detecting a valid alternative
    hypothesis.
-   Power is calculated as one minus the probability of a Type II error.
    Power = 1 - $\beta$
-   A test with low power results in a higher chance of not rejecting
    the null hypothesis when it should in fact be rejected.

For example, if we conclude that the null hypothesis: *equal numbers of
males and females* cannot be rejected, then it may be that the test of
proportion being used has a low power and we are simply not detecting
the actual difference.

This may be a case of no *statistical difference* when there is a
*meaningful real difference*.

***Note: It is also possible to find a statistically significant
difference that is not a scientifically significant or meaningful
effect. Being a slave to p-values can lead you into trouble - there is
no substitute for common sense and scientific knowledge. You should
always ask yourself" "Does this result make sense?"***

# 2. Specific Tests of Hypotheses I

## 2.1 Hypothesis Testing: The Proportion versus a Stated Value

See the week 3/4 lecture notes for theory, details and examples.

Use binomial if sample size no more than 20.

Use normal approximation for sample size \> 20.

## 2.2 Hypothesis Testing: The Mean versus a Stated Value (The one-sample t-test)

***Two-tailed hypotheses:*** \begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu = \mu_0\\
H_1:  & \mu \neq \mu_0
\end{align*}

***One-tailed Upper hypotheses:*** \begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu \leq \mu_0\\
H_1:  & \mu > \mu_0
\end{align*}

***One-tailed Lower hypotheses:*** \begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu \geq\mu_0\\
H_1:  & \mu < \mu_0
\end{align*}

Using theory: If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ then
$\overline{X}_n \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$. Applying the standard
normal ($Z$) transform we get the test statistic:

$$
T = \frac{\overline{X}_n - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0, 1).
$$

Generally, however, we do not know the population standard deviation
$\sigma$. Instead, we estimate it using the sample standard deviation
$s$. Introducing this extra level of uncertainty into the test statistic
changes the distribution of the test statistic to a Student's $t$:

$$
T = \frac{\overline{X}_n - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}.
$$

The hypothesised value for $\mu$ ($\mu_0$) is substituted into the
formula along with the values calculated from the sample -- mean and
standard deviation -- to obtain the sample test statistic. The
calculated sample test statistic is compared with the relevant critical
value from the Student's $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

R: A one-sample t-test can be carried out using `t.test()` in R. See R
section for details.

## 2.3 Hypothesis Testing: Difference Between Two Means I --Independent Samples (The two-sample t-test)

***Two-tailed hypotheses:*** \begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu_1 = \mu_2\\
H_1:  & \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
\end{align*}

where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the respective means of the two
populations to be compared.

***One-tailed Hypothesis:*** \begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu_1 \leq \mu_2\\
H_1:  & \mu_1 > \mu_2
\end{align*}

Or

***One-tailed Hypothesis:*** \begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu_1 \geq\mu_2\\
H_1:  & \mu_1 < \mu_2
\end{align*}

***Note that in the two-sample t-test the tail of a one-tailed
hypothesis test (upper or lower) depends on how you calculate the test
statistic. This will be discussed in lectures.***

Using theory: If $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)$ and
$X_2 \sim N(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$ then
$(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) \sim N(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \sigma_{\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2}^2)$.

The situation where $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are known is most unlikely
and will not be discussed.

The estimation of $\sigma_{\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2}^2$ depends
on whether or not $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ can be assumed equal.

Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ denote the sample sizes taken from populations 1 and
2, respectively. Let $s_1$ and $s_2$ denote the standard deviations of
each sample taken from populations 1 and 2, respectively.

**Standard deviations unknown but assumed equal (Pooled Procedure)**

$$
\widehat{\sigma_{\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2}^2} = s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}.
$$

Therefore

$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}.
$$

The Test Statistic is:

$$
T = \frac{(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu2)}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}} \sim t_{n_1 + n_2 -2} \text{ if } H_0 \text{ is true.}
$$

$s_p$ is known as the *pooled sample standard deviation*.

**Standard deviations unknown but cannot be assumed equal**

The Test Statistic is:

$$
T = \frac{(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim t_{n_1 + n_2 -2} \text{ if } H_0 \text{ is true.}
$$

**NOTE:**

-   For large sample sizes, $T \sim Z$.
-   for small sample sizes, $T \sim t$ with weighted DF.

In this course, the situation of unequal standard deviations and small
samples will not be considered further.

***Question: Why would a test to compare means be of interest if
populations have unequal standard deviations?***

The hypothesised value for $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$ under $H_0$ is substituted
into the formula along with the values calculated from the sample (means
and standard deviations) to obtain sample test statistic. The calculated
sample test statistic is compared with the relevant critical value of
$t$.

**NOTE:** When comparing the means from two populations using the test
statistic shown above, the choice of which sample mean is subtracted
from the other is arbitrary. For two-tailed hypotheses this is not an
issue. However, it can create an issue for one-tailed tests when
deciding whether the test is upper or lower tailed. This will be
discussed further in lectures.

## 2.4 Hypothesis Testing: Difference Between Two Means I --Paired Samples (the Paired t-test)

The same experimental unit is measured twice. E.g. Standing and lying
down blood pressures. In these cases the data are not independent.

Here, we first calculate the ***difference*** between the two measures
on each individual. Then we apply the one-sample t-test to the
\*\**difference* variable.

***Example:***

Twelve randomly selected individuals had their blood pressure measured
in both standing and lying down positions. The data is given in the
table below.

| Subject | Standing BP | Lying Down BP | Difference |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
|    1    |     132     |      136      |     4      |
|    2    |     146     |      145      |     -1     |
|    3    |     135     |      140      |     5      |
|    4    |     141     |      147      |     6      |
|    5    |     139     |      142      |     3      |
|    6    |     162     |      160      |     -2     |
|    7    |     128     |      137      |     9      |
|    8    |     137     |      136      |     -1     |
|    9    |     145     |      149      |     4      |
|   10    |     151     |      158      |     7      |
|   11    |     131     |      120      |    -11     |
|   12    |     143     |      150      |     7      |
|  Mean   |     --      |      --       |    2.50    |
|   SD    |     --      |      --       |    5.50    |

**Two-tailed Paired t-test**

$H_0:$ There is no difference between the mean blood pressures in the
two populations

$H_1:$ There is a difference between the mean blood pressures in the two
populations

Since the two populations are paired (ie the same indivicuals are
measured twice), we are actually testing the whether the population mean
difference ($\mu_D$)is zero or not:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
H_0:  & \mu_{D} = 0 \\
H_1:  & \mu_{D} \neq 0
\end{align*}
```
This is just a one-sample t-test on the difference data: ie, use the
difference data as the sample and caclulate its sample mean
($\overline{X}_D$) and sample standard deviation ($s_D$). We can then
use these in the one-sample t-test test statistic:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac{\overline{X}_n - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} \\
  &= \frac{\overline{X}_D - \mu_D}{s_D/\sqrt{n}} \\
  &= \frac{2.5 - 0}{5.5/\sqrt{12}} \\
  &= 1.574.
\end{align*}
```
From tables, $t_{11}(0.975) = \pm 2.2010$. Since $T = 1.574$ is not
greater than 2.010 (or less than -2.010) we cannot reject the null at
the 0.05 level of significance. We conclude there is insufficient
evidence to suggest that the mean standing blood pressure differs from
the mean lying blood pressure.

**One-tailed versions will be discussed during lectures**.

# 3. Using R

## 3.1 More Probability Functions:

Use the functions: `pnorm(z, mean, sd)` and `pt(t, df)` to find the
cumulative probability for particular values of $Z$ and the calculated
t-test statistic, $T$ based on Specified degrees of freedom (`df`).

**Eg:** An art auction produces normally distributed sale prices with a
mean of 1600 dollars and a standard deviation of 220 dollars. What is
the probability that a particular painting will cost at least 2000
dollars?

Let $X$ denote sales prices. We want to find
$Pr(X > 2000) = 1 - Pr(X \leq 2000)$.

```{r pnorm, exercise=TRUE}
1 - pnorm(2000, mean = 1600, sd = 220)

# Or, convert to Z-value first:

z <- (2000 - 1600)/220
1 - pnorm(z)
```

(Exercise: Modify the above code to find the probability that a painting
will cost 5000 dollars or less.)

Suppose now that the standard deviation given above had been estimated
from a random sample of 10 of the paintings. Student's $t$ should be
used (with df = 9) rather than the normal. Note you should convert the
figure to a Z-value first before using the `pt` function:

```{r pt, exercise=TRUE}
z <- (2000 - 1600)/220
1 - pt(z, df = 9)
```

## 3.2 Testing a Mean -- The One-Sample t- test

Use the `t.test()` function in R:

`t.test(x, alternative, mu)`

EG: Student's sleep data (1908) contain data on the extra amount of
sleep gained (hours) from two types of soporific drug. Twenty patients
were randomly assigned to either drug 1 or drug 2 (10 patients in each
group) and their extra amount of sleep obtained was recorded. [NB:
Actually the data are paired - 10 patients measured twice, but we are
going to pretend they are independent groups of patients for the next
two exercises].

Let's test whether the mean amount of extra sleep is greater than 0
hours, across both groups. In other words, do both the drugs increase
mean hours of sleep?

The data are in R already, so we just need to use the `t.test()`
function:

```{r 1-sample-t, exercise=TRUE}
# Print out the data, note the variable names
sleep

# Do the hypothesis test:

t.test(sleep$extra, alternative = "greater", mu = 0)
```

(Exercise: How would you modify the above code if you wanted to test
whether the mean extra hours of sleep is significantly less than 1
hour?)

## 3.3 Testing the Difference Between Two Means -- The Two-Sample t-test

Again, we use the `t.test()` function in R to do two-sample t-tests.

Suppose in the sleep example we want to test whether the mean extra
hours of sleep differs between the two drugs. We simply do the
two-sample t-test comparing the two groups (drugs) using the `t.test()`
function:

```{r 2-sample-t, exercise=TRUE}

# Do the hypothesis test:
t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep)
```

(Exercise: Investigate what R means when it says "Welch Two Sample
t-test" in the output. Start by looking at the help for `t.test()` using
`?t.test` in the R console).

## 3.4 Testing the Mean Difference Between Paired Data -- The Paired t- test

Recall the blood pressure example. Enter the data and then do the test.

```{r paired-t, exercise=TRUE}
# Enter the data:
standing.bp <- c(132,146,135,141,139,162,128,137,145,151,131,143)
lying.bp <- c(136,145,140,147,142,160,137,136,149,158,120,150)

# Do the test:
t.test(lying.bp, standing.bp, paired = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")

# OR, create the differences yourself first:
diff <- lying.bp - standing.bp
t.test(diff, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0)
```

(Exercise: Can you work out how to do a paired t-test on Student's sleep
data? Remember, the data are actually paired.)
