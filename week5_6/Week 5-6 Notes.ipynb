    "(Macquarie Concise Dictionary, 1996)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common problem areas in research design is inadequate clarification of the research hypothesis – it must be specific and unambiguous; it must be clear what is to be measured. What may seem obvious to the researcher at the time may be less than obvious to someone else, for example a research assistant actually collecting the data, and may be no longer obvious to anyone at a later date!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "- Stating the specific belief\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Resources, Required Detectable Differences, Significance Level Required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resources:** The resources that are available for the study need to be assessed at the beginning of the project and compared with the resources required to achieve the desired aim. If the two are not compatible, proceeding with the research may be a complete waste of time and money. Statistical input can help with this process, and ‘clever’ designs may enable research that would otherwise not be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detectable Differences:** It is important to recognise the difference between ‘statistical difference’ and ‘observed difference’. For example, two sample means may have different values, but because of the variation associated with the measurement, it is not possible to say that they come from different populations – they are not statistically different. The researcher needs to think about the minimum difference he wishes to be able to detect – this will influence the size of the sample needed in the experimental design. It may also mean that the resources will not be sufficient; this will mean further thinking and maybe the decision not to go ahead with the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Significance Level:** The chance the researcher is willing to take of incorrectly supporting the research hypothesis – usually designated by $\\alpha$ (alpha).\n",
    "- Traditionally the level is set at 0.05 or 0.01, **why?**\n",
    "- The level depends on the situation.\n",
    "- 0.05 and 0.01 are like hair lengths, different people and/or problems require different reliabilities - be yourself!\n",
