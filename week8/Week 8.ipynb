    "\n",
    "If $H_0$ is false, i.e. some difference (or differences) do exist, interest lies in determining where\n",
    "the differences do occur; which treatment means are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of tests exist for comparisons of multiple treatment means, the most common of\n",
    "which is the extended (or protected) t-test. Other tests in common usage include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tukey’s q\n",

    "- Duncan’s Multiple Range Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Protected (Extended) t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "The original t-test was designed to compare two treatment means. If this test is simply\n",
    "extended and used to carry out all possible pairwise comparisons between more than two\n",
    "treatments, spurious significance may be found simply because so many of the tests are done -\n",
    "each test may be at a prescribed level of significance related to its specific type I error\n",
    "probability, but over all the possible tests this probability of error (the experimentwise error)\n",
    "may be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this problem a requirement is imposed that the F-test in the ANOVA must be\n",
    "significant before any t-tests are carried out. If the overall test for significance says that there\n",
    "are no significant differences then no further testing is carried out.\n",
    "The t-test with this conditioning on the outcome of the F-test is known as the Protected t-\n",
    "test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though significant differences may occur in pairwise t-testing, if the F-test in the\n",
    "ANOVA is not significant, the null hypothesis that all treatment means are equal must be\n",
    "accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing the F-test is significant, at least two treatment means will be detected as\n",
    "significantly different when the t-tests are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment means are considered in pairs and each pair is tested using the standard t-test.\n",
    "EXCEPT that: in applying each test, the standard deviation used is that obtained from the\n",
    "error mean square in the ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the degrees of freedom appropriate for each individual t-test are the error degrees\n",
    "of freedom in the ANOVA.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the extended t-test as described above must only be applied after a significant\n",
