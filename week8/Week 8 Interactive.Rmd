# 1. Multiple Comparisons of Treatment Means

## 1.1 Introduction

In the ANOVA, the F-test is used to test the overall hypothesis of equality of all treatment
means.

If $H_0$ is false, i.e. some difference (or differences) do exist, interest lies in determining where
the differences do occur; which treatment means are different.

A number of tests exist for comparisons of multiple treatment means, the most common of
which is the extended (or protected) t-test. Other tests in common usage include:

- Tukey’s q

- Student-Neuman-Keull’s Multiple Range Test

- Scheffe’s Test

- Bonferroni

- Duncan’s Multiple Range Test

## 1.2 The Protected (Extended) t-test

The original t-test was designed to compare two treatment means. If this test is simply
extended and used to carry out all possible pairwise comparisons between more than two
treatments, spurious significance may be found simply because so many of the tests are done -
each test may be at a prescribed level of significance related to its specific type I error
probability, but over all the possible tests this probability of error (the experimentwise error)
may be quite different.

To overcome this problem a requirement is imposed that the F-test in the ANOVA must be
significant before any t-tests are carried out. If the overall test for significance says that there
are no significant differences then no further testing is carried out.
The t-test with this conditioning on the outcome of the F-test is known as the Protected t-
test.

Even though significant differences may occur in pairwise t-testing, if the F-test in the
ANOVA is not significant, the null hypothesis that all treatment means are equal must be
accepted.

Providing the F-test is significant, at least two treatment means will be detected as
significantly different when the t-tests are done.

The treatment means are considered in pairs and each pair is tested using the standard t-test.
EXCEPT that: in applying each test, the standard deviation used is that obtained from the
error mean square in the ANOVA.

Similarly, the degrees of freedom appropriate for each individual t-test are the error degrees
of freedom in the ANOVA.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Remember the extended t-test as described above must only be applied after a significant
F-test has been found. This proviso gives a "protection" to the test to prevent the detection of 
false significant differences which can arise simply by comparing the highest and lowest of a number of means.

T = \frac{4.67 - 6.80}{\sqrt{0.4685}\sqrt{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}}} = \frac{-2.13}{0.6845\sqrt{0.5333}} = \frac{-2.13}{0.4999} = -4.261.

>
> The overall conclusion is that species 2 and 3 do not differ with respect to mean wing thickness. Species 1 butterflies have, on average, a mean wing thickness significantly less than that of butterflies of species 2 and 3 ($\alpha = 0.05$).








## 1.3 Least Significant Differences - LSD

When a number of pairwise $t$-tests are carried out following an ANOVA, much of each
calculation is common to all tests. This is especially true if there are equal replicates for some
of the treatments.

The standard deviation, $s$, and the critical region are always the same as they use the ANOVA
error results. In the case of equal replications for each treatment, the standard error of the difference
between the two means will be the same for all pairs of comparisons:

$$
SE_{\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j} = s\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}
$$

where $s = \sqrt{\text{EMS}}$ from the ANOVA and $n$ is the number of (equal) reps in each treatment.

Instead of evaluating the test statistic for all possible treatment pairs, the test statistic formula
can be rearranged to find the **smallest difference** that must exist between any two means for
significance to be reached. (Note that this is similar to the approach taken to find a confidence interval).

Using the traditional level of significance of 0.05, the critical value is: $t_{\nu}(0.025)$ (these comparisions are ***always*** two-tailed). Substituting this in the equation for the test statistic T, gives:

$$
T = \frac{|\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j|^{\text{LSD}}}{s\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}}} > t_{\nu}(0.025).
$$

Rearranging and solving for $|\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j|^{\text{LSD}}$ gives:

$$
|\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j|^{\text{LSD}} > t_{\nu}(0.025) \times s \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}}
$$

where $|\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j|^{\text{LSD}}$ is the difference that must exist between means $i$ and $j$ if the test statistic is to just
reach significance; that is, for $T$ to be just larger than $t_v(0.025)$.

When all treatments have the same number of replicates, say $n$, only one LSD needs to be
found for all the pairwise comparisons. If the replicates differ a LSD value must be calculated
for every pair of differing replicates (this situation is not considered in this course).

The next step is to find all differences between the means and compare them with the relevant
LSD.

**Table of Mean Differences**

The most efficient way of looking at the differences between the means is to construct a table
of mean differences as follows:


|                                              | Means Ranked in Ascending Order $\rightarrow$ |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Means Ranked in Descending Order $\downarrow$**| matrix of differences between treatment means |

> **Example: Fuel Efficiency**
>
> An experiment was carried out to compare the fuel efficiency (measured as a percentage) of
petrol engines using different fuels. Five fuel types were used, each replicated four times.
>
> The statistical hypotheses are:
>
> \begin{align*}
H_0:& \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 = \mu_5 \\
H_1:& \text{The mean fuel efficiencies are not the same for all five fuel types}
\end{align*}
>
> where $\mu_i$ is the mean fuel efficiency of fuel type $i$.
>

**Example: Harvester Example Revisited**

Do this by hand yourself, then check your results using R. 

How close are the estimates of treatment means and the standard deviation to the values we started with - remember we assumed these values and then constructed (simulated) these data?

```{r harvestdat, exercise = T}
harvesting.system <- factor(rep(c("nil", "CS1", "CS2", "new"), each = 5))
observations <- rep(55, 20)
dat <- data.frame(harvesting.system, observations)
dat$observations <- dat$observations + rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 10)
sys.effect <- rep(c(35, 5, -5, -35), each = 5)
dat$observations <- dat$observations + sys.effect
dat
```

**Example: Growth Curves - Marine Birds**

An ESC researcher is studying the growth rates of young marine birds on the Great Barrier Reef. The growth curve of these birds is known to be logistic in nature with a functional form as follows:   

$$W  =  \frac{K}{1 + exp(-r(t - t_m))}$$,

where:

- $W$ is the weight in grams of the individual bird at time $t$ days;

- $K$  is the asymptotic weight of the individual bird (its adult weight);

- $r$  is the growth constant for the individual bird; 

- $t$  is the time from birth in days; 

- $t_m$ is the time in days to reach a weight of $K/2$ grams.  

It is believed that different species have different growth patterns which are reflected in different values for the coefficients, $K$, $r$ and $t_m$.  The growth curves of six individual birds from each of three species were studied.  The breeds involved and the resulting coefficients are given below. 

| Bridled |Tern   |        | Black | Noddy       |             | Crested |Tern       |   |

| 105.0   | 9.7   | 0.1594 | 96.4  | 8.3    | 0.2171 | 280.4   | 12.8       | 0.1474 |

| 124.7   | 14.9  | 0.1087 | 104.4 | 7.6    | 0.1707 | 291.5   | 17.2       | 0.1453 |
| 127.1   | 13.0  | 0.1097 | 115.2 | 10.1   | 0.1346 | 290.7   | 13.8       | 0.1342 |

Analyse these data to determine in what way (if any) the growth patterns differ between the
three species. Initially consider $t_m$ , the time to reach half the adult weight.
